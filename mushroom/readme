First I loaded all the given mushroom_train and mushroom_test data using pandas library into train and test
Droped 'veil-type' column because all of its values are same.
Label encoding every column for further preprocessing
plotted a violin plot for every column of train set againt 'class' column of train set.
The best plot I got was of 'odor' against 'class' because maximum data is getting directly mapped

Then by filtering we get the data not directly mapped and stored it in 'remaining' dataframe.

again ploting plotted a violin plot for every column of 'remaining' set againt 'class' column of 'remaining' set.
